# PokéStat
A quick and clean GUI for checking pokemon stats with IVs, EVs and natures.

## Why
I am plagued with a terrible burden of perfectionism when it comes to games. I want the most optimal strats and stats, and the Pokémon series of games only exacerbate this issue of mine.

While playing through the newest (at time of writing) games, Scarlet and Violet, I got frustrated at the lack of convenient tools available to quickly compare a recently caught Pokémon's stats to their given IV values.

Sure, Smogon exists, but having to create a new team, search the pokemon and fiddle with the level each time got grating. I decided, screw that, I'm making my own - it was a much needed distraction from the disappointly buggy mess those games turned out to be anyway.

## Resources
PokéStat uses [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) to source its stat data.
I sourced the stat formulae from [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page)
